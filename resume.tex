\runsubsection{Multi-Agent ChatGPT}
\descript{}
\location{In-Development}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Allow users to create group chats with friends, and an AI personality.
\item Motivation: Group chats are fun, but it's easy to lose context and forget what people have said in the past. ChatGPT is awesome, but I want my friends to join in the conversation too.
\item Tech Stack: React Native (Typescript), Supabase.js with Postgres (iOS Beta available on TestFlight).

\location{Development Paused}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Track and visualize daily activities/habits as booleans.
\item Motivation: I love tracking and visualizing data about my life, and used to keep a daily spreadsheet of over 60 columns. Thought to myself, wouldn't this be better as an app/website?
\item Tech Stack: React (Typescript) with Google Firebase (https://yaylinda.github.io/life-as-booleans/). React Native (Typescript) with Google Firebase (iOS Beta available on TestFlight).
\item Future Plans: Temporarily paused when Apple announced this functionality as a native app on iOS 17.

\location{Seeking Inspiration}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Collection of seven HomeScreen widgets, that I designed and developed, for the Scriptable App on iOS. With over 300+ stars and 100+ forks on GitHub.
\item Motivation: Apple didn't allow widgets on the HomeScreen for the longest time. Even now, many widgets are basic and do not contain enough information.
\item Tech Stack: JavaScript (https://github.com/yaylinda/scriptable)
\item Future Plans: Seeking inspiration for other widgets!
